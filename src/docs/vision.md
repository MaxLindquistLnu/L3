## Vision — Cipher Tool App

Make cryptography approachable and useful for learners and hobbyists by providing a clean, interactive web tool that demonstrates a few classic ciphers and their behaviors in real time.

### Mission

Provide an intuitive, educational playground where users can encode and decode text with Caesar, Vigenère, Atbash (and perhaps future ciphers), explore parameters (shift/keyword), and immediately see how changes affect the output.

### Target users
- Students learning introductory cryptography
- Hobbyists experimenting with classic ciphers
- Developers needing quick, reproducible cipher examples

### Core features
- Live encode/decode for Caesar, Vigenère, Atbash
- Simple controls: encode/decode toggle, cipher selector, shift/keyword inputs
- Input/output fields

### Success criteria
- Users can perform encode/decode flows within 30 seconds of opening the app
- All cipher outputs match canonical test vectors (automated tests pass)
